Jarvis is a Light-weight Library contains very useful functions, 
like NullCoalescing and TryParse for Java. 

NullCoalescing: 

In class *PlasticMetal.Jarvis.Common*, 
CoalesceNull(a,b) equals a??b (as C# expression)

TryParse:

In class *PlasticMetal.Jarvis.Parse*,
each TryParse function returns a TryResult, 
whose field *Result* represents whether 
the parsing succeeded or not, 
and field *Out* stores the output of parsing.
